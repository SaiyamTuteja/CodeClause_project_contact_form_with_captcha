I'm excited to announce my latest project on GitHub - a contact form with captcha code built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was inspired by the need for a secure and user-friendly contact form that prevents spam and bot attacks.

The contact form is designed using HTML and CSS to create an attractive and responsive layout that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices. The form's functionality is implemented using JavaScript, which allows for real-time validation of user inputs and prevents the submission of incorrect or incomplete data.

To enhance the security of the contact form, I have integrated a captcha code that requires users to verify that they are not bots. This captcha code is easy to use and does not add any significant inconvenience to users while ensuring that the form is not vulnerable to spam or bot attacks.

This project is open-source and available on GitHub, and I encourage other developers to contribute to it and provide feedback on how it can be improved. Overall, I'm proud of the work I've put into this project, and I'm excited to share it with the developer community.
